# GPS-Interfacing-with-ARM-LPC2148
This project demonstrates how to interface a GPS module with the LPC2148 ARM microcontroller to receive location data. The system reads NMEA sentences from the GPS module and extracts latitude and longitude information. The code is written in Embedded C using Keil uVision IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
